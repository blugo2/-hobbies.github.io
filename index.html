  <h1 class="display-4">What is this Website?</h1>
  <p class="lead"><strong>This website was created using Django. The CSS and JS was created using help from Bootstrap.</strong></p>
  <hr class="my-4">
  <p>If you are looking at this website and thinking, "Man, its kinda bland" you'd be correct! It IS bland. That's because prior to two days ago I knew anothing about Djanog, but YouTube is a wonderul teacher for those willing to learn. The next question you may be asking yourself is "Why'd he make this website in two days?" Well THATS beacause I was asked if I had any additional projects to show for a potential job position and upon realizing that I didn't, I set out to make one.<br><br> The conent I am displaying on this website is information about my hobbies, and interests, if you are here looking for something more professional such as skills and job experince head on over to this website <a href="https://blugo2.github.io"><strong>My resume website.</strong></a></p></p>

<h4 style="text-align:center; margin-bottom:5rem;">My logic behind creating this website</h4>
<div class="container" style="margin-bottom:15rem";>	<!-- Container for the Cards -->
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col">	<!---Container for right most card-->

		<div class="card-body">
		<h5 class="card-title">Diligent</h5>
		<h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Hard Working</h6>
		<p class="card-text"> While this website was not made with Flask, Django is very similar and I am confident the skills I learned to create this website will transfer over quite nicly with Flask. It is my intention to provide the best work I possiably can over the summer with your team. I hope this proves that. </p>

		<div class="card-body">
		<h5 class="card-title">Commited</h5>	
		<h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Team Oriented</h6>
		<p class="card-text">I understand that a great team needs great team memebers. It is my understand that two skills all the best teams in the world have are communication, and commitment. What better way to show that I am commited to providing the best work I can with your team then creating this website?</p>

		<h5 class="card-title">Adaptive</h5>
		<h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Quick Learner</h6>
		<p class="card-text">When I realized that the competition for this position was high, and you were struggling to decide on which candidates to pick up I knew I need to help you decide. It is my hope that by creating this website with Django while having no prior knoweldge just two days ago shows that I am quick to pick up new skills. </p>
